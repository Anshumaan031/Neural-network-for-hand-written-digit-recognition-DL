# Neural-network-for-hand-written-digit-recognition-DL
Points to be noted
This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. 
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
scalling the values to range of 0-1 to increase accuracy score.
A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.
dense layer mean the neuron is connected to each every other neuron of the next layer.
mention no. of neurons in next layer and the neurons in current layer with activation function.
number of neurons for the hidden layer is taken based on trail and error.
adding more and more hidden layers imroves accuracy
